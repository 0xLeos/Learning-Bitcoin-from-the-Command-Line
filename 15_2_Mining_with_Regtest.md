# 15.2: Mining the Regtest

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

This document explains how to generate (i.e. mine) blocks using a Regtest (Regression Test) blockchain.
To generate the Genesis block and the next blocks on a new blockchain requires very minimal proof-of-work, due to the low difficulty and that it follows the Testnet rules.


## Generating blocks

You can generate/mine new blocks using the RPC method `generate`. This method is only available in the Regtest mode, using the following command:
```
$ bitcoin-cli -regtest generate 101

  "631ff7b8135ce633c774828be3b8505726459eb65c339aab981b10363befe5a7",
  ...
  "1162dbfe025c7da94ee1128dc26d518a94508f532c19edc0de6bc673a909d02c",
  "20cb2e815c3d42d6a117a204a0b5e726ab641c826e441b5b3417aca33f2aba48"
]
```
The output is the block hash of every block generated (in our example, 101 hashes).


This command will generate 101 blocks using a special RPC which is only available in regtest mode. This takes less than a second on a generic PC.
Because this is a new block chain using Bitcoinâ€™s default rules, the first blocks pay a block reward of 50 bitcoins.
Unlike mainnet, in regtest mode only the first 150 blocks pay a reward of 50 bitcoins.
However, a block must have 100 confirmations before that reward can be spent, so we generate 101 blocks to get access to the coinbase transaction from block #1.
