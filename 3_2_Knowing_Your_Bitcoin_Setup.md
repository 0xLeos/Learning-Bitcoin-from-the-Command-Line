# 3.2: Knowing Your Bitcoin Setup

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

Before you start playing with Bitcoin, you may always want to come to a better understanding of your setup.

## Know Your Directory

If your bitcoind is running and you've downloaded all the blocks, you're probably ready to go. However, it's best to look at the main ~/.bitcoin directory, both to make sure everything is there and to understand for yourself how everything works.

The main directory just contains your config file and the testnet directory:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin
bitcoin.conf  testnet3
```
The testnet3 directory then contains all of the guts:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin/testnet3
banlist.dat   blocks	  database  debug.log  wallet.dat
bitcoind.pid  chainstate  db.log    peers.dat
```
You shouldn't mess with most of these files and directories â€” particularly not the blocks and chainstate directories, which contain all of the blockchain data. However, do take careful note of the db.log and debug.log file, which you should refer to if you ever have problems with your setup.

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** If you're using mainnet, then _everything_ will instead be placed in the main ~/.bitcoin directory. These various setups _do_ elegantly stack, so if you are using mainnet, testnet, and regtest, you'll find that ~/.bitcoin contains your config file and your mainnet data, ~/.bitcoin/testnet3 contains your testnet data, and ~/.bitcoin/regtest contains your regtest data.

## Know Your Bitcoin-cli Commands

Most of your work will be done with the "bitcoin-cli" command. If you ever want more information on its usage, just run the help argument. Without any other arguments, it shows you ever possible command:
```
$ bitcoin-cli help

sendrawtransaction "hexstring" ( allowhighfees )
signrawtransaction "hexstring" ( [{"txid":"id","vout":n,"scriptPubKey":"hex","redeemScript":"hex"},...] ["privatekey1",...] sighashtype )

sendtoaddress "bitcoinaddress" amount ( "comment" "comment-to" subtractfeefromamount )
setaccount "bitcoinaddress" "account"
settxfee amount
signmessage "bitcoinaddress" "message"
```
You can also type "bitcoin help [command]" to get even more extensive info on that command. For example:
```
$ bitcoin-cli help getmininginfo
getmininginfo

Returns a json object containing mining-related information.
Result:
{
  "blocks": nnn,             (numeric) The current block
  "currentblocksize": nnn,   (numeric) The last block size
  "currentblockweight": nnn, (numeric) The last block weight
  "currentblocktx": nnn,     (numeric) The last block transaction
  "difficulty": xxx.xxxxx    (numeric) The current difficulty
  "errors": "..."            (string) Current errors
  "networkhashps": nnn,      (numeric) The network hashes per second
  "pooledtx": n              (numeric) The size of the mempool
  "testnet": true|false      (boolean) If using testnet or not
  "chain": "xxxx",           (string) current network name as defined in BIP70 (main, test, regtest)
}

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli getmininginfo 
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getmininginfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
```
## Optional: Know Your Bitcoin Info

A variety of commands will give oyu move info on your setup:
```
$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
$ bitcoin-cli getmininginfo
$ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
$ bitcoin-cli getnettotals
$ bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
```
Feel free to play with any of these, and use "bitcoin-cli help" if you want more information on what any of them do.


## Summary: Verifying Your bitcoin-cli Setup

Before you start playing with bitcoin, you should make sure that the bitcoind is running and that all the blocks have been downloaded. You might get additional help from the `bitcoin-cli help` command or from files in the ~/.bitcoin directory.
