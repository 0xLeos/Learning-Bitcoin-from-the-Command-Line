This section presumes that you have a VPS with bitcoin installed, running bitcoind. It also presumes that you are connected to testnet, allowing for access to bitcoins without using real funds. You can either do this by hand, per [2.1: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS by Hand](./2_1_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_by_Hand.md), or do it with a Linode StackScript at Linode.com, per [2.2: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with StackScript](./2_2_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.md).
