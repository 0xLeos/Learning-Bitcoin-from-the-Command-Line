# 3.1: Verifying Your bitcoin-cli Setup

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

Before you start playing with Bitcoin, you should ensure that everything is setup correctly.

## Check Your Aliases

The Bitcoin setup docs suggest creating a set of aliases. In case you didn't run through those docs, you can create them for your main Bitcoin user with the following command:

```
cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
alias btcdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/" #linux default bitcoind path
        # alias btcdir="cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/" #mac default bitcoind path
alias bc="bitcoin-cli"
alias bd="bitcoind"
alias btcinfo='bitcoin-cli getinfo | egrep "\"version\"|balance|blocks|connections|errors"'
alias btcblock="echo \\\`bitcoin-cli getblockcount 2>&1\\\`/\\\`wget -O - http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/q/getblockcount 2> /dev/null | cut -d : -f2 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev\\\`"
EOF
```

> **WARNING:** The btcblock alias will not work correctly if you try to place it in your .bash_profile by hand, rather than using the "cat" command as suggested. If you want to enter it by hand, you need to adjust the number of backslashes (usually from three each to one each), so make sure you know what you're doing if you aren't entering the commands exactly as shown.

Note that these aliases includes shortcuts for running `bitcoin-cli`, for running `bitcoind`, and for going to the Bitcoin directory. These aliases are mainly meant to make your life easier. We suggest you create other aliases to ease your use of frequent commands (and arguments) and to minimize errors. Aliases of this sort can even more useful if you have a complex setup where you regularly run commands associated with Mainnet, with Testnet, _and_ with Regtest.

With that said, use of these aliases in _this_ document might accidentally obscure the core lessons being taught about Bitcoin, so the only aliases directly used here are `btcinfo` and `btcblock`, because they encapsulate much longer and more complex commands. Otherwise, we show the full commands; adjust for your own use as appropriate.

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** Remember that this tutorial generally assumes that you are using testnet. Notes like this will comment on how things might be different over on Mainnet. In this case, the `btcblock` alias needs to be slightly different. On testnet, you can look up the current block count with the complex command "wget -O - http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/q/getblockcount 2> /dev/null | cut -d : -f2 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev"; on mainnet, you use the much simpler "wget -O - http://blockchain.info/q/getblockcount 2>/dev/null".

## Run Bitcoind

You'll be accessing the Bitcoin network with the `bitcoin-cli` command. However, bitcoind _must_ be running to use bitcoin-cli, as the bitcoin-cli sends JSON-RPC commands to the bitcoind. If you used our standard setup, bitcoind should already be up and running. You can double check by looking at the process table.
```
$ ps auxww | grep bitcoind
user1    29360 11.5 39.6 2676812 1601416 ?     SLsl Feb23 163:42 /usr/local/bin/bitcoind -daemon
```
If it's not running, you'll want to run "/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -daemon" by hand and also place it in your crontab, as explained in [2A - Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS by Hand](./2A_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_by_Hand.md).

## Verify Your Blocks

You should have the whole blockchain (or the whole pruned blockchain) ready before you start playing. Just run the `btcblock` alias to see if it's all loaded. You'll see two numbers, which tell you how many blocks have loaded out of how many total.

If the two numbers aren't the same, as shown in this testnet example, you should wait:
```
$ btcblock
973212/1090099
```
Total time can take from several hours to a day, depending on your setup.

If the two numbers are the same, as shown in this testnet example, you're fully loaded:
```
$ btcblock
1090099/1090099
```

## Check Your Directory

If your bitcoind is running and you've downloaded all the blocks, you ready to go. You could move right on to Part 1. However, you may want to be aware of other Bitcoin resources. To start with, take a look at your ~/.bitcoin directory.

The main directory just contains your config file and the testnet directory:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin
bitcoin.conf  testnet3
```
The testnet3 directory then contains all of the guts:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin/testnet3
banlist.dat   blocks	  database  debug.log  wallet.dat
bitcoind.pid  chainstate  db.log    peers.dat
```
You shouldn't mess with most of these files and directories â€” particularly not the blocks and chainstate directories, which contain all of the blockchain data. However, do take careful note of the db.log and debug.log file, which you should refer to if you ever have problems with your setup.

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** If you're using mainnet, then _everything_ will instead be placed in the main ~/.bitcoin directory. These various setups _do_ elegantly stack, so if you are using mainnet, testnet, and regtest, you'll find that ~/.bitcoin contains your config file and your mainnet data, ~/.bitcoin/testnet3 contains your testnet data, and ~/.bitcoin/regtest contains your regtest data.

## Get Help

Most of your work will be done with the "bitcoin-cli" command. If you ever want more information on its usage, just run the help argument. Without any other arguments, it shows you ever possible command:
```

## Summary: Verifying Your bitcoin-cli Setup

Before you start playing with bitcoin, you should make sure that the bitcoind is running and that all the blocks have been downloaded. You might get additional help from the `bitcoin-cli help` command or from files in the ~/.bitcoin directory.
