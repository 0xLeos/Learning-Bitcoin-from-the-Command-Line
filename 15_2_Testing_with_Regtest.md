# 15.2: Testing with Regtest

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

This document explains how to test a Regtest (Regression Test).

## Testing with Regtest

After [starting Bitcoind using Regtest mode](15_1_Building_the_Regtest.md) you can use any `bitcoin-cli` command or interact with the blockchain using the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service.

You can try to create transactions referring to [Chapter 4 - Sending Bitcoin Transactions](04_0_Sending_Bitcoin_Transactions.md) in this guide. In order to get balance in your Regtest Wallet, you are able to [mine blocks with minimal proof-of-work and get the rewards](15_3_Mining_with_Regtest.md).
