# 8.5: Spending a Transaction with a Bitcoin Script

Before we close out an overview of P2SH transactions, it's worth briefly discussing how to spend them!

## Use the Redeem Script

As we saw in [ยง6.2: Spending a Transaction to a Multisig](6_2_Spending_a_Transaction_to_a_Multisig.md), spending a P2SH transaction is all about having that serialized version of the locking script, the so-called _redeemScript_. So, the first step to being able to spend a P2SH transaction is ensuring that you save the _redeemScript_ before you give out the P2SH address to everyone. 

Because P2SH addresses aren't integrated into `bitcoin-cli` there will be no short-cuts as you saw in [ยง6.3: Sending an Automated Multisig](6_3_Sending_an_Automated_Multisig.md). You're going to need to collect all the more complex variables on your own!

## Create the Transaction

[Notes: I *think* this is just the same as what we did in chapter 6.2, but I need to actually receive a P2SH transaction to test it, and that requires first getting to the APIs, then using one to send myself a P2SH transaction, then writing up how to respend that.]

[Notes: Say it's just like respending that multisig, the hard way]
