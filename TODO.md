# TODOs

This is a list of potential (or planned) TODO items for "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line". Many are drawn from issues found at the previous locale of this repo.

## 1. Add BTCDEB Support

Per @ChristopherA:

> @kallewoof has written a better Bitcoin Script debugging tool at https://github.com/kallewoof/btcdeb â€” we should re-write chapter 7 to use it.

`btcdeb -v` will now show you what BTC Core version it's based on in its minor version. As of now it's `0.2.19`, which is BTC Core 0.19.

## 2. Update Setup Instructions & Script to Debian 10

Per @matthiasdebernardini, our current script no longer works.
