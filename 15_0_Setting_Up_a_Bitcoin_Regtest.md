# Chapter 15: Setting Up a Bitcoin Regtest

While developing Bitcoin applications, you might want to use your applications isolated from any public Blockchain such as the Mainnet or the Testnet.
You can create a Blockchain from scratch using the Regtest, with one main advantage over Testnet: you choose when to create new blocks, so you have complete control over the environment.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Create your own Blockchain from scratch
   * Create the Genesis block and more blocks on top of it
   * Get balance and interact with Bitcoind in a private way
