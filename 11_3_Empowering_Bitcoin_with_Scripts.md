 # 11.3: Empowering Bitcoin with Scripts

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

Bitcoin Scripts can go far beyond the relatively simple financial instruments detailed to date. They're also the foundation of most more complex usages of the Bitcoin network, as demonstrated by these real-world examples of off-chain functionality, drawn from the Lightning Network examples in BIP 112.

## Lock for the Lightning Network

The [Lightning Network](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=450) is a payment channel that allows users to take funds off-chain and engage in numerous microtransactions before finalizing the payment channel and bringing the funds back into Bitcoin. Benefits include lower fees and faster transaction speeds.

[BIP 112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) contains a few examples of how transactions could be locked in the Lightning Network.

### Lock with Revocable Commitment Transactions

The trick with Lightning is that it's off-chain. The participants jointly lock funds on Bitcoin with an n-of-n multisignature, then they engage in a number of transactions between themselves. Each new "commitment transaction" splits those joint funds in a different way; it's partially signed but _it isn't put on the blockchain_. 

So how do you keep one of the participants from reverting back to an old transaction that's more beneficial to them? That's where revocation comes in. You give the participant who would be harmed by reversion to a revoked transaction the ability to reclaim the funds himself if the another participant illegitamately tried to use the revoked transaction.

For example, presume that Alice updated the commitment transaction to give more of the funds to Bob (effectively: she sent funds to Bob via the Lightning network). As part of this new transaction, she gives Bob a `revokeHash` which can be used to claim the funds from the previous transaction, before Alice gave Bob the new funds.

The locking script from that revoked commitment transaction looks as follows:
```
OP_HASH160 
<revokeHash> 
OP_EQUAL
    
IF
        
    <pubKeyBob>
    
ELSE

    <+24Hours> 
    OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY 
    OP_DROP
    <pubKeyAlice>
    
ENDIF
OP_CHECKSIG
```
Theoretically, this transaction should never be spent at the point. Bob has no incentive to because he has the newer transaction, after Alice sent him the new funds. Alice has no incentive too, because she loses the funds if she tries. So no one puts the transaction onto the blockchain, and the off-chain transactions continue.

But what if Alice tried to cheat? She puts the transaction back onto the blockchain even though it's been revoked. Now the locking script comes to the rescue!

#### Run the Lock Script for Cheating Alice, with Revocation Code

Alice could try to use revocation code that she gave to Bob to immediately claim the funds. She sends in `<sigAlice> <revokeCode>`:
```
Script: <sigAlice> <revokeCode> OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ ]

Script: OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <revokeCode> ]

Script: <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <revokeCode> OP_HASH160 
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <revokeHash> ]

Script: OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <revokeHash> <revokeHash> ]

Script: IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <revokeHash> <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ <sigAlice> True ]
```
The `OP_EQUAL` feeds the `IF` statement. Because Alice uses the hash, she gets into the branch that allows her to redeem the funds immediately, collapsing the rest of the script down to `<pubKeyBob>` (within the conditional) and `OP_CHECKSIG` (afterward).
```
Script: <pubKeyBob> OP_CHECKSIG
Running: True IF
Stack: [ <sigAlice> ]
```
Curses! Only Bob can sign immediately with the hash!
```
Script:  OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <pubKeyBob> ]

Script:
Running: <sigAlice> <pubKeyBob> OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ False ]
```
#### Run the Lock Script for Cheating Alice, without Revocation Code

So what if Alice instead tries to use her own signature, without the revocation code?
```
```
Script: <sigAlice> 0 OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ ]

Script: OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> 0 ]

Script: <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: 0 OP_HASH160 
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <0Hash> ]

Script: OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <0Hash> <revokeHash> ]

Script: IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <0Hash> <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ <sigAlice> False ]
```
We now collapse down to the `ELSE` statement and what comes after the conditional
```
Script: <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> OP_CHECKSIG
Running: False IF
Stack: [ <sigAlice> ]

Script: OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <+24Hours> ]
```
And then Alice is foiled again because 24 hours haven't gone by!
```
Script: OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY 
Stack: [ <sigAlice> <+24Hours> ] â€” Script EXITS
```
#### Run the Lock Script for Virtuous Bob

What this means is that Bob has 24 hours to reclaim his funds if Alice ever tries to cheat, using the `<revokeCode>` and his signature:
```
```
Script: <SigBob> <revokeCode> OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ ]

Script: OP_HASH160 <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <SigBob> <revokeCode> ]

Script: <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <revokeCode> OP_HASH160 
Stack: [ <SigBob> <revokeHash> ]

Script: OP_EQUAL IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <SigBob> <revokeHash> <revokeHash> ]

Script: IF <pubKeyBob> ELSE <+24Hours> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubKeyAlice> ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG
Running: <revokeHash> <revokeHash> OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ <SigBob> True ]

Script: <pubKeyBob> OP_CHECKSIG
Running: True IF
Stack: [ <SigBob> ]


Script:  OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ <SigBob> <pubKeyBob> ]

Script:
Running: <SigBob> <pubKeyBob> OP_CHECKSIG
Stack: [ True ]
```
#### Run the Lock Script for Virtuous Alice

All of the commitment scripts are locked with this same transaction, whether they've been revoked or not. That means that the newest commitment script, which is the currently valid one, is locked with it as well. In this situation Alice has never sent a new transaction to Bob and thus never sent him the `revokeCode`. She can now close down the Lightning channel at this point. She puts the transaction on the chain and she waits 24 hours. Bob can't do anything about it because he doesn't have the recovation code. Then, after the wait, Alice reclaims her funds. (Bob does the last thing with his last valid transaction.)
