# 3 - Playing with Bitcoin

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

This document explains how to begin using Bitcoin from the command line. It presumes that you have a VPS that you installed bitcoin on and that is running bitcoind. It also presumes that you are connected to testnet, allowing for access to bitcoin without using real funds. We explained how to do this either by hand in [2A - Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS by Hand](./2A_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_by_Hand.md) or by using a Linode StackScript at Linode.com in [2B - Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with StackScript](./2B_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.md).

## Part Zero: Getting Started with Bitcoin

Before you start playing with Bitcoin, you should ensure that everything is setup correctly.

### Check Your Aliases

The Bitcoin setup docs suggest creating a set of aliases. In case you didn't run through those docs, you can create them for your main Bitcoin user with the following command:

```
cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
alias btcdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/" #linux default bitcoind path
        # alias btcdir="cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/" #mac default bitcoind path
alias bc="bitcoin-cli"
alias bd="bitcoind"
alias btcinfo='bitcoin-cli getinfo | egrep "\"version\"|balance|blocks|connections|errors"'
alias btcblock="echo \\\`bitcoin-cli getblockcount 2>&1\\\`/\\\`wget -O - http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/q/getblockcount 2> /dev/null | cut -d : -f2 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev\\\`"
EOF
```

> **WARNING:** The btcblock alias will not work correctly if you try to place it in your .bash_profile by hand, rather than using the "cat" command as suggested. To enter it by hand, you need to adjust the number of backslashes (usually from three each to one each), so make sure you know what you're doing if you aren't entering the commands exactly as shown.

Note that these aliases includes shortcuts for running 'bitcoin-cli', for running 'bitcoind', and for going to the Bitcoin directory. These aliases are mainly meant to make your life easier. We suggest you create other aliases to ease your use of frequent commands or strings and to minimize errors. Aliases of this sort can even more useful if you have a complex setup where you regularly run commands associated with Mainnet, with Testnet, _and_ with Regtest.

With that said, use of these aliases in _this_ document might accidentally obscure the core lessons being taught about Bitcoin, so the only aliases directly used here are 'btcinfo' and 'btcblock', because they encapsulate much longer and more complex commands. Otherwise, we show the full commands; adjust for your own use as appropriate.

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** Remember that this tutorial generally assumes that you are using testnet. Notes like this will comment on how things might be different over on Mainnet. In this case, the 'btcblock' alias needs to be slightly different. On testnet, you can look up the current block count with the complex command "wget -O - http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/q/getblockcount 2> /dev/null | cut -d : -f2 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev"; on mainnet, you use the much simpler 'wget -O - http://blockchain.info/q/getblockcount 2>/dev/null'

### Run Bitcoind

You'll be accessing the Bitcoin network with the bitcoin-cli command. However, bitcoind _must_ be running to use bitcoin-cli. If you used our standard setup, it should be. You can double check by looking at the process table.
```
$ ps auxww | grep bitcoind
user1    29360 11.5 39.6 2676812 1601416 ?     SLsl Feb23 163:42 /usr/local/bin/bitcoind -daemon
```
If it's not running, you'll want to run '/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -daemon' by hand and also place it in your crontab, as explained in [2A - Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS by Hand](./2A_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_by_Hand.md).

### Verify Your Blocks

You should have the whole blockchain (or the whole pruned blockchain) ready before you start playing. Just run the 'btcblock' alias to see if it's all loaded. You'll see two numbers, which tell you how many blocks have loaded out of how many total.

If the two numbers aren't the same, as shown in this testnet example, you should wait:
```
$ btcblock
973212/1090099
```
Total time can take several hours for a pruned testnet, a day for a pruned mainnet or a non-pruned testnet, and longer for a non-pruned mainnet.

If the two numbers are the same, as shown in this testnet example, you're ready to go:
```
$ btcblock
1090099/1090099
```

### Check Your Directory

If your bitcoind is running and you've downloaded all the blocks, you ready to go. You could move right on to Part 1. However, you may want to be aware of other Bitcoin resources. To start with, take a look at your ~/.bitcoin directory.

The main directory just contains your config file and the testnet directory:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin
bitcoin.conf  testnet3
```
The testnet3 directory then contains all of the guts:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin/testnet3
banlist.dat   blocks	  database  debug.log  wallet.dat
bitcoind.pid  chainstate  db.log    peers.dat
```
You shouldn't mess with most of these files and directories â€” particularly not the blocks and chainstate directories, which contain all of the blockchain data. However, do take careful note of the db.log and debug.log file, which you should refer to if you ever have problems with your setup.

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** If you're using mainnet, then _everything_ will instead be stuck in the main ~/.bitcoin directory. These various setups _do_ elegantly stack, so if you are using mainnet, testnet, and regtest, you'll find that ~/.bitcoin contains your config file and your mainnet data, ~/.bitcoin/testnet3 contains your testnet data, and ~/.bitcoin/regtest contains your regtest data.

### Get Help

Most of your work will be done with the "bitcoin-cli" command. If you ever want more information on its usage, just run the help argument. Without any other arguments, it shows you ever possible command:
```

You can also type "bitcoin help [command]" to get even more extensive info on that command. For example:
```
$ bitcoin-cli help getmininginfo
getmininginfo

Returns a json object containing mining-related information.
Result:
{
  "blocks": nnn,             (numeric) The current block
  "currentblocksize": nnn,   (numeric) The last block size
  "currentblockweight": nnn, (numeric) The last block weight

  "testnet": true|false      (boolean) If using testnet or not
  "chain": "xxxx",           (string) current network name as defined in BIP70 (main, test, regtest)
}

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli getmininginfo 
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getmininginfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
```

### Optional: Know Your Setup Types

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** When you set up your node, you choose to create it as either a Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtest node. Though this document presumes a testnet setup, it's worth understanding how you might access and use the other setup types â€” even all on the same machine!

The type of setup is mainly controlled through the ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file. If you're running testnet, it probably contains this line:
```
testnet=1
```
While if you're running regtest, it probably contains this line:
```
regtest=1
```
However, if you want to run several different sorts of nodes, you will probably decide to leave the testnet (or regtest) flag out of your configuration file. In this case, you can choose whether you're using the mainnet, the testnet, or your regtest every time you run bitcoind or bitcoin-cli.

Here's a set of aliases that would make that easier by creating a specific alias for starting and stopping the bitcoind, for going to the bitcoin directory, and for running bitcoin-cli, for each of the mainnet (which has no extra flags), the testnet (which is -testnet), or your regtest (which is -regtest).
```
alias bcstart="bitcoind -daemon"
alias btstart="bitcoind -testnet -daemon"
alias brstart="bitcoind -regtest -daemon"

alias bcstop="bitcoin-cli stop"
alias btstop="bitcoin-cli -testnet stop"
alias brstop="bitcoin-cli -regtest -stop"

alias bcdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/" #linux default bitcoin path
alias btdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/testnet" #linux default bitcoin testnet path
alias brdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/regtest" #linux default bitcoin regtest path

alias bc="bitcoin-cli"
alias bt="bitcoin-cli -testnet"
alias br="bitcoin-cli -regtest"
```
For even more complexity, you could have each of your 'start' aliases use the -conf flag to load configuration from a different file. This goes far beyond the scope of this tutorial, but we offer it as a starting point for when your explorations of Bitcoin reach the next level.

## Part One: The State of the Chain and the Wallet

You're now ready to work directly with the blockchain and your own wallet. To beging with, you should learn a bit about the state of these elements.

### Create an Address

The first thing you need to do is create an address for receiving payments. This is done with the "bitcoin-cli getnewaddress" command. Remember that if you want more information on this command, you should type "bitcoin-cli help getnewaddress".

Theoretically, you could run it just by typing it on the command line:
```
$ bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
n4cqjJE6fqcmeWpftygwPoKMMDva6BpyHf
```
However, this isn't best practice; if you retype that address or cut and paste it, it would be easy to make a mistake. And then you're telling people to send money to somewhere else (or to nowhere!). So instead we suggest a best practice, which is meant to minimize address mistakes.

#### BEST PRACTICES: Use Variables to Capture Addresses

Instead, use your shell's built in variables to capture your address.
```
$ unset NEW_ADDRESS_1
$ NEW_ADDRESS_1=$(bitcoin-cli getnewaddress)
```
These commands clear the NEW_ADDRESS_1 variable, then fill it with the results of the "bitcoin-cli getnewaddress" command.

You can then use your shell's "echo" command to look at your (new) address:
```
$ echo $NEW_ADDRESS_1
n4cqjJE6fqcmeWpftygwPoKMMDva6BpyHf
```
Note that this address begins with an "n" (but sometimes an "m"). This signifies that this is a testnet address. 

> **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** The equivalent mainnet address would start with a 1.

We'll use this same technique for other bitcoin-cli results in the future; note that you could do it all by hand, instead of piping stuff in and out of variables ... but we really don't suggest it.

### Capture the Private Key

The address lets you receive bitcoins, but to spend them, you'll need the address' private key. That's achieved with the "bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey" command. The following extracts the address from the variable created by the best practices, above, them dumps the private key into another variable:
```
$ unset NEW_PRIV_KEY_1
$ NEW_PRIV_KEY_1=$(bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey "$NEW_ADDRESS_1")
```
As usual, an echo will show you what you have:
```
$ echo $NEW_PRIV_KEY_1
cW4s4MdW7BkUmqiKgYzSJdmvnzq8QDrf6gszPMC7eLmfcdoRHtHh
```
Usually you would not want to share this with anyone! And, in fact, you might need to use other techniques to save it when you have real addresses, receiving real money in the future!

### Sign a Message

You can also sign a message using your address (and your bitcoind) without needing your private key on hand. You do this with "bitcoin-cli signmessage [address] [message]". For example:
```
$ bitcoin-cli signmessage $NEW_ADDRESS_1 "Hello, World"
H3yMBZaFeSmG2HgnH38dImzZAwAQADcOiMKTC1fryoV6Y93BelqzDMTCqNcFoik86E8qHa6o3FCmTsxWD7Wa5YY=
```
This verifies that the message for the address was signed by the person who knew the address' private key. A recipient can verify it if he inputs the address, the signature, and the message.
```
$ bitcoin-cli verifymessage "n4cqjJE6fqcmeWpftygwPoKMMDva6BpyHf" "H3yMBZaFeSmG2HgnH38dImzZAwAQADcOiMKTC1fryoV6Y93BelqzDMTCqNcFoik86E8qHa6o3FCmTsxWD7Wa5YY=" "Hello, World"
true
```
If some black hat was making up signatures, they'd instead get a negative result:
```
$ bitcoin-cli verifymessage "n4cqjJE6fqcmeWpftygwPoKMMDva6BpyHf" "FAKEBZaFeSmG2HgnH38dImzZAwAQADcOiMKTC1fryoV6Y93BelqzDMTCqNcFoik86E8qHa6o3FCmTsxWD7Wa5YY=" "Hello, World"
false
```
### Get Some Money

To do anything more, you need to get some money. On testnet this is done through faucets. Since the money is all pretend, you just go to a faucet, request some money, and it's sent over to you. We suggest using the faucet at http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/ . If it's not available for some reason, search for "bitcoin testnet faucet", and you should find others.

To use a faucet, you'll usually need to go to a URL and enter your address. Yes, this violates our Best Practices, but that's how the faucets tend to work.
